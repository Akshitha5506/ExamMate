Project Overview:

ExamMate is developed to address the difficulty faced by students who prefer audio-based learning, especially in rural and low-internet areas.

The system works completely offline and runs on a Raspberry Pi. Users can interact with the system using voice commands to select subjects and listen to questions.

This project focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and ease of learning.
